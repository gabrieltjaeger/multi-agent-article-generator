## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Python ‚â• 3.12 and < 3.13**  
  Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed. You can check your version by running:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

If you don‚Äôt have it installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> **Note:** Python 3.13.x is currently **not supported** due to dependency issues. Please use **Python 3.12.x**.

---

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabrieltjaeger/multi-agent-article-generator.git && \
cd multi-agent-article-generator
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a **`.venv`** folder for your virtual environment to keep it hidden and standardized:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**

  ```cmd
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

If successfully activated, your terminal prompt will start with `(.venv)`.

---

#### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary packages for the project.

---

#### 5. Create a `.env` File

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` and fill in the required environment variables, such as your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`.

---

#### 6. Run the Project

Make sure your virtual environment is active, then start the application:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

---

### üßπ Additional Notes

- Always remember to **activate the virtual environment** before working on the project.
- You can deactivate it at any time by running:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
